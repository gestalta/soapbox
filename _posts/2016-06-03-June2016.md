# Performer biographies

# Edna & Anea Capaken

Edna and Anea Capaken have been tying together for more than two years now, and their approach to rope has evolved during that time from tying fancy ties to enjoying the pure intimacy. Edna focuses more on feeling emotions than showing off complicated ties, she uses just a few ropes to tie beautiful Anea. Their connection is based on mutual trust, respect, love, a piece of rope and a cane.

# Laced Lines & Laura Cylon

"I think the beauty of rope is many-faceted, and completely dependent on who you tie with. As a top I revel in their beauty, their suffering and their pleasure in a visceral way. The way that I tie can be very close and overwhelming - I love to play with tempo and expectation.
Laura and I haven’t tied together for many years, so I expect this tie to be part excitement of a reunion long overdue, and part joy in blissful chemistry."
