# Alberto No Shibari & Kuss
After starting as Shibari students emulating traditional techniques in their shows, Alberto No Shibari and Kuss began the search for a structure for their own performances. In this search, they translated the influence of the essential elements of Japanese bondage to the imagery and tradition of their own visual culture.

Inspired by the Western artistic representations and the need to create a scene to convey emotional intensity from the outset, they have created a number of innovative techniques to maximize the deep togetherness achieved along years of work on stage.

Always accompanied by a carefully chosen sound environment and away from the usual skilled riggers, acrobatic models, and mainstream semenawa Alberto No Shibari and Kuss create a minimalist scene in which the communication, emotion, expressionist ties, mix in exact proportion to achieve moments of intense beauty.

# Avalon & Laura Cylon
Avalon is an Italian/Australian rigger known for his sensual and attentive bondage. He has been involved in BDSM for over 20 years and has been fascinated by the intrinsic beauty of Japanese Rope Bondage since seeing a Japanese bondage show in Paris in the 80â€²s.

In his pursuit to improve his skills and knowledge in Japanese Rope Bondage he often travels to Japan as student of Osada Steve and Yukimura Haruki.

Avalon has developed his own distinctive style, his work is fluid and sensory, relying on triggers and sensitivities of his model to lull them into a forbidden world. His style keeps faith to traditional Japanese bondage where mind, edge and predicament play are key factors of the tying process.
