I'm really excited to announce that the April Soap Box will host the uniquely creative Glü Wür, who will be performing a new variation, created especially for us, on her self bondage piece 'Bag'.

"'Bag' is a self suspension about non identity. Stereotypes that tend to pigeonhole people in a certain prejudices. This performance is reminder that every human being is unique and unrepeatable."

Stay tuned for more performer announcements in the coming days!

# Glü Wür

Glü Wür is a Chilean artist who lives in Barcelona, where she conducts various studies, the practice of shibari mixed with acrobatic aerial being one of her specialisations.

"Training and performing with ropes has brought me to many people. Connecting in a different way to what people imagine about bondage.
For me it is a very sensual art, rather than sexual; emotional nonverbal communication that delivers confidence through being tied up. Bonding with my play partners is a very enriching experience, and when practicing self bondage or self suspension the adrenaline is so nice, finding control over the pain.”

Her work has been seen in Barcelona, Valencia, Madrid, London, San Francisco/CA and Santiago/Chile.
