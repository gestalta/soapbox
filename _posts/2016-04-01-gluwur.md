# Performer biographies

# Glü Wür

Glü Wür is a Chilean artist who lives in Barcelona, where she conducts various studies, the practice of shibari mixed with acrobatic aerial being one of her specialisations.

"Training and performing with ropes has brought me to many people. Connecting in a different way to what people imagine about bondage.
For me it is a very sensual art, rather than sexual; emotional nonverbal communication that delivers confidence through being tied up. Bonding with my play partners is a very enriching experience, and when practicing self bondage or self suspension the adrenaline is so nice, finding control over the pain.”

Her work has been seen in Barcelona, Valencia, Madrid, London, San Francisco/CA and Santiago/Chile.

# Maisy Taylor

Maisy Taylor is an aerial artist with a First Class Honours Degree from The National Centre for Circus Arts. Her work is often about the collision of sex and art. She is interested in the distinction between art and pornography, and produces work that is sensual, honest and raw, lying somewhere just between reality and fantasy.

# Gestalta & Sophia

Gestalta was first introduced to shibari in 2007, and began using it as a form of performance art in 2009. Her performance work often focuses on bold dynamic transitions and movements, which she likes to contrast by presenting in a soft, subtle, and feminine way.
She performed in Japan, Australia, and around the UK and Europe.

Sophia is a discovered Shibari in 2014 when she met Gestalta at an event in London. Since then she has developed a great passion for learning more about herself and connecting with others through the experience of Shibari. Her favourite style of rope is intense, dynamic and contorted. She feels very honoured to have already traveled to Japan, USA and Europe as a rope bottom/model for workshops, events and performance.
